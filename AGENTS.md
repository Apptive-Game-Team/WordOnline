# Agent Instructions for the WordOnline Monorepo

This repository is a multi-module monorepo composed of Git submodules. Agents working in this repository must follow the repository-level rules below and the module-specific instructions for the target component.

## 1. Scope and Instruction Precedence

Before making changes:

1. Identify the module that owns the requested behavior.
2. Change the working directory to that module.
3. Read the module's `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files when present.
4. Follow module-specific build commands, coding conventions, branch rules, skills, and documentation.

Module-specific instructions supplement this file. When instructions conflict, the more specific instruction for the target module takes precedence.

## 2. Module Map

- `client/`: Unity web and desktop client
- `game/`: Spring Boot in-game server
- `lobby/`: Spring Boot matchmaking and lobby server
- `account/`: Spring Boot authentication and key-value server
- `admin/`: Spring Boot administration web server
- `website/`: React and Vite web frontend
- `database/`: Flyway database migrations

Keep changes within the owning module unless the task requires an explicit cross-module contract change.

## 3. Graphify Knowledge Graph

This repository maintains a Graphify knowledge graph in `graphify-out/`. Use it as the primary navigation and architecture-discovery source when the graph is available.

### Required Workflow

- When `/graphify` is invoked, load the `graphify` skill before performing other work.
- For codebase or architecture questions, if `graphify-out/graph.json` exists, run `graphify query "<question>"` before manually searching the repository.
- To inspect a concept and its immediate relationships, run `graphify explain "<concept>"`.
- To trace the shortest relationship between two concepts, run `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` from the repository root to refresh the deterministic AST graph. This update does not require additional LLM extraction.

Treat Graphify output as navigational evidence, not a substitute for validating relevant source files before editing.

## 4. Security

- Never commit `.env` files from the repository root or any submodule.
- When environment-related files change, verify the applicable root or module-level `.gitignore`.
- Never expose credentials, tokens, private endpoints, or other secrets in source, logs, tests, documentation, or generated artifacts.

## 5. Submodule Change Management

Each submodule has an independent Git history. For submodule changes:

1. Commit and push changes from within the submodule.
2. Return to the monorepo root.
3. Update and commit the submodule pointer in the parent repository.

Do not commit a parent-repository submodule pointer that references an unpublished submodule commit.
